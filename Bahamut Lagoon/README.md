## Priorities

2. Dragon food
   - Includes excess weapons and armor from upgrades or battle.
   - *Mushrooms* until all dragons have maximum *Dexterity*, *Mind*, *Thunder*, *Life*, and *Poison*.
   - *Difficult Books* and *Porno Mags* to recover lost *Wisdom* and *Strength* and raise to 250, respectively.
   - *Armor* to raise *Vitality* to 250.
   - *Mushrooms* again until *HP* reaches 9999.
3. Healing items
4. *Magic Gins* to raise dragon *MP*.

- Grasses, weapons, and armor can be sold for cash to buy *Mushrooms* once relevant statistics are maxed out.

## Dragon Statistics

### Normal

- *Strength* affects physical attacks and *Bite*. Raised by feeding weapons.
- *Vitality* affects defense and *Body Blow*. Raised by feeding armor.
- *Dexterity* affects speed in battle and accuracy with *Claw*. Raised by feeding rapiers or mushrooms.
- *Mind* affects spells and *Sonic Boom*. Raised by feeding books, mushrooms, rods, or robes.

### Elemental

- Normal elements are *Fire*, *Ice/Water*, and *Thunder*. These boost respective elemental techniques of the associated party.
- *Life* is also known as *Recovery* and affects healing/HP-draining techniques.
- *Poison* is also known as *Death* and affects poison skills.
- Invisible stats
  - *Earth* is equal to the lowest of the normal elements.
  - *Holy* is 0 for most forms or 10 for Holy and Master forms.
  - *Dark* is 0 for most forms or 10 for Dark and Master forms.
  - *Transform* is raised by using *Princess's ???* items and after using all 5 will raise the stat to 100 at which point the dragon will become a *Behemoth*.

### Miscellaneous

- *Fidelity* possibly affects how often a dragon appears randomly in melee battle. At 10 a dragon becomes a *Uni Uni* which can be reverted with a heal.
- *Loyalty* applies when a dragon is a *Uni Uni* and is effectively an elemental statistic in this state. Otherwise it is speculated to affect what the dragon does when it appears randomly in melee battle.
- *Wisdom* is also known as *Intelligence* and affects AI choices during battle. Raised by feeding books.
- *Intimacy* should be maintained near 5 to balance a dragon's independence. Raised with *Sweet* items and lowered with *Bitter* items.
